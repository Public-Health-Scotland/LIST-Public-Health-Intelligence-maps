# Services mapping script 1 - Primary and Secondary Care locations

# This script extracts data on primary and secondary care locations from 
# publicly available resources and aggregates them into a consistent format
# for mapping. 

# Specifically:
# - GP practices
# - Care homes
# - Hospitals (All types)
# - Pharmacies

# The main data source is opendata.nhs.scot (operated by PHS), however, it also
# uses the Scottish Care inspectorate (careinspectorate.com) and National
# Records of Scotland data to link service data together. The script has been
# structured to largely function automatically however, some URLs may need to
# be updated as geographic boundaries/relationships change over time.

# 2. Loading location data ------------------------------------------------

## 2.1. GP Data ----

# Identify most recent data
most_recent_practice_sizes = package_show(id = "gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes", url = "https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/", as = "table")[["resources"]] %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(id, name, created) %>%
  arrange(desc(created)) %>%
  filter(created == max(created)) %>%
  pull(id)

# Extract most recent data
GP_Locations <- get_resource(most_recent_practice_sizes) %>%
  dplyr::select(practice_code=PracticeCode,practice_name=GPPracticeName,postcode=Postcode) %>%
  mutate(practice_code = as.character(practice_code))

# Some GP practices are registered as a dispensary site. This code helps prevent 
# double-counting of these sites.
pharmacy_filter <- GP_Locations$practice_code

## 2.2 . Care Home Data ----

# Identify most recent data
link = "https://www.careinspectorate.com/index.php/publications-statistics/93-public/datastore"

most_recent_care_home_data_url = read_html(link) %>% 
  html_elements(css = ".button") %>%

  mutate(end_of_url=unlist(lapply(end_of_url,last))) %>%
  mutate(date=as.Date(end_of_url,"MDSF_data_%d %B %Y.csv")) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(date == max(date)) %>%

# Extract most recent data

  dplyr::select(care_home_number=CSNumber,type=CareService,subtype=Subtype,postcode=Service_Postcode)

## 2.3. Hospital Info ----

# Determines *types* of hospitals
most_recent_hospital_info = package_show(id = "nhs-scotland-accident-emergency-sites", url = "https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/", as = "table")[["resources"]] %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(id, name, created) %>%

  as_tibble() %>%
  select(id, name, created) %>%

  filter(created == max(created)) %>%
  pull(id)

Hospital_Locations <-   get_resource(most_recent_hospital_codes_info)  %>%
  dplyr::select(hosp_code=HospitalCode,postcode=Postcode)

### Combining hospital data ----
Hospital_Locations_Full <- Hospital_Info %>%
  left_join(Hospital_Locations,by=c("hosp_code")) %>% 
  # Converting Type codes into descriptive category
  mutate(type = case_when(type == "Type 1" ~ "Emergency Department",

                          type == "Type 3" ~ "Minor Injuries Unit/Other"))

## 2.4 Pharmacy locations ----

# Identify most recent data
most_recent_dispenser_sites = package_show(id = "dispenser-location-contact-details", url = "https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/", as = "table")[["resources"]] %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(id, name, created) %>%
  arrange(desc(created)) %>%
  filter(created == max(created)) %>%
  pull(id)

# Extract most recent data
Pharmacy_Locations <- get_resource(most_recent_dispenser_sites) %>%
  dplyr::select(pharm_code = DispCode, pharm_name = DispLocationName, postcode = DispLocationPostcode) %>%
  mutate(pharm_code = as.character(pharm_code)) %>%

# 3. Split Some Data Into Service Types ----

## 3.1. Care Services ----
